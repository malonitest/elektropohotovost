A: Call the distributor (PRE: 1236, ČEZ: 800 850 860, EG.D: 800 22 55 77) if:
- Power outage affects the entire street/neighborhood

For issues inside your property (circuit breakers, outlets, wiring), call us.

**Q: What should I do first during a power outage?**  
A: Check if the circuit breaker tripped. If it did, DO NOT repeatedly reset it. Disconnect appliances and call us for safe diagnosis. If you smell burning, see sparks, or detect smoke, turn off the main breaker and call immediately.
